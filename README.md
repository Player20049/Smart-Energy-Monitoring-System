# âš¡ Smart Energy Meter with Real-Time Anomaly Detection

A Raspberry Pi-based real-time current and voltage monitoring system using the ACS712 and ZMPT101B sensors. It logs power usage, detects anomalies, and controls a relay intelligently. This project is part of a signal processing and AI pipeline intended for smart energy analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was developed as part of my personal learning and engineering development using signal processing, embedded systems, and basic AI ideas. It captures voltage and current data from sensors, logs it into a CSV, and allows further analysis in MATLAB for pattern recognition, filtering, and anomaly detection.

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

- âœ… Read analog signals from ACS712 (current sensor) and ZMPT101B (voltage sensor)
- âœ… Control a relay based on real-time current thresholds
- âœ… Log the following features in a CSV file:
  - Timestamp
  - Voltage
  - Current
  - Power (W)
  - Cumulative Energy (Wh)
  - Relay State & Relay Changed flag
  - Current Spikes & Voltage Fluctuations
- âœ… Analyze data in MATLAB for signal processing and ML
- ðŸ§  Future: Train ML models for event classification or anomaly detection (TensorFlow Lite)
